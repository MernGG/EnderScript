# Usage
There are five differnt options of usage.
  1. Run the batch file(opens console)
  2. Run exe WorkHW(opens console)
  3. Run WorkHW invis(Doesnt open a console, better for being stealthy)
  4. Everything with adm forces admin rights to get better results with less errors. 

# Recommended Way to Use
Easiest way to use is demostrated here --> https://streamable.com/pbd05e
Just drag and drop the app into you taskbar and press it when needed.

# How to add/delete programs
If you want to add/delete a program for the exe edit the script.bat file and add/delete the programs that you want

# Difference between the exes'
  - The WorkHW and script.bat both show a console window with what closed and what didnt
  - The WorkHW invis doesnt show a console and closes a little faster
  
# Some warnings/erros
  - Don't close windows tasks like windows explorer because it will mess with your computer and if you do completely shutting down your computer will fix it.
  - EAC and other Anticheats will give you an error when closing the games used by them. 
  - Most games wont close without admin rights so i recommend using the admin versions. 

# Why
Idk why I made this its pretty usefull in certain situations but I was just bored.
Didnt make it in py because batch is much easier for this kind of stuff.
